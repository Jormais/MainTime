# MainTime
An easy way to measure your time

At this moment this app is composed of two views, the first one is a table 
where we will add an event, the second one is a detail view of the event in 
which we will be able to record and modify data of the event.

First, a table for creating, viewing and accessing events, as well as a search engine to
facilitate this process for users.
To facilitate this process for the users, in the table you will have the possibility to 
create new events and delete them when they are finished.

As a second screen we have a detailed view, right now it has a basic timer which can be used for the following: 

1. start
2. pause
3. resume
4. stop

Here are some gifs to show you a little bit of functionality
