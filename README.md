An easy way to measure your time

A view with a basic timer with 4 functions has been created: 

1. start
2. pause
3. resume
4. stop

A table has been added to display and access the events as well as a search engine to facilitate this process for users, in the table you will have the possibility to create new events and delete them when they are finished.
